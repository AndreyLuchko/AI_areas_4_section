The section of areas is a popular element of landing pages. In this challenge, I will have to code a section showing the 4 sub-categories that an artificial intelligence start-up is researching. The design must have reproduced as accurately as possible.

## Brief

The goal of the task is to code a section describing the areas that the AI ​​company is researching. The section contains a brief description of systems based on artificial intelligence and 4 areas in which the start-up reviewed by the user specializes. All tiles have the same arrangement of elements inside, so the end result should be one code base with appropriate modifiers.

To complete the task, use the starter code included in the asset pack, for styling, use the __[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)__ preprocessor. 

As a result, the project should meet the following assumptions:

- Tiles should be able to take any length of text in the description
- If one of the boxes in a row has longer text than the others, then on the desktop version all tiles in this row should be aligned in height to the longest. For the mobile version, each tile should have a height consistent with the length of the text
- The website should be properly displayed on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
- The website should have properly handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening after hovering over the interactive element)
